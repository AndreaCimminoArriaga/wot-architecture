This directory contains the use cases 
for the next revision (V1.1) of the WoT architecture.

# Stakeholders, actors and roles

We use common terminology across the use cases to make sure 
everybody has the same understanding and the descriptions match
when we combine the use case in a single document.

## Currently used in use case descriptions

### Stakeholders/actors

device owners  
device user  
cloud provider  
service provider  
device manufacturer   
gateway manufacturer  
network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)  
identity provider  
directory service operator?  

Please avoid domain specific terminology, e.g. don't use MNO, telco. Better use network operator instead.

Please put all your use cases into this directory adopting the format in <em>use-case-template.md</em>.
