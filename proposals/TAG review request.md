Further details (optional):

  - [X] I have read and filled out the [Self-Review Questionnare on Security and Privacy](https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/). The [assessment is here](https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/proposals/WoT%20Architecture%20Security%20and%20Privacy.html).
  - [X] I have reviewed the TAG's [API Design Principles](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/)

You should also know that...

- The [WoT Security and Privacy Considerations](https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/) document provides extra discussion of security with an IoT focus.
- The related [WoT Thing Description](https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description) document is being submitted for TAG review at the same time.
- The [WoT Binding Templates](https://github.com/w3c/wot-binding-templates) non-REC track informative document describes an optional WoT building block.
- The [WoT Scripting API](https://github.com/w3c/wot-binding-templates) non-REC track informative document describes an optional WoT building block.


We'd prefer the TAG provide feedback as (please select one):

  - [ ] open issues in our Github repo for each point of feedback
  - [X] open a single issue in our Github repo for the entire review
  - [ ] leave review feedback as a comment in this issue and @-notify [github usernames]
